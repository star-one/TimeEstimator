# Time Estimator
A little form that lets you estimate how long it will take to complete a long piece of work on the basis of how long it takes to complete a sample of that work.

Picture the scene - you're a web content editor and you've got a Big Task of migrating all your content from one CMS to another CMS, and you need to estimate how long that will take. You've got 500 pages to migrate, so you migrate 10 of them and time how long it takes. You measure that it takes 340 minutes to migrate 10 pages, so you can average that down to 34 minutes per page.

By then multiplying that 34 minutes by 500 you see that it'll take you 11 days, 19 hours, and 20 minutes of total billable production time to migrate all 500 pages.

But you don't just want to know how much billable time it'll take, you want to know physically how long it will take, based on a 7 hour working day - you calculate from that that it'll take you 40 days, 3 hours, and 11 minutes of real elapsed time based on 7 hour working days.

But actually, you're not going to be working on migrating content for every minute of those 7 hour working days, you'll go completely spare! You'll only actually be spending about 70% of the working day on the task, bumping up the real elapsed time to 57 days, 5 hours, and 46 minutes.

Problem is your managers have left it a bit late to actually start this task, because they forgot that the contract for the existing CMS expires in 14 days. Fortunately there was a significant underspend on another project which the budget holder has agreed can be spent on hiring in some temporary help for you, if you all work 7 day weeks. Phew!

You thus calculate that if there are 4 of you on the task you can get the whole thing done in 14 days, 3 hours, and 11 minutes; that's a squeeze, so you persuade the boss to give you budget for 5 people getting the job done in 11 days, 3 hours, and 57 minutes. Time to spend a bit more time finessing!

This little form snippet is the calculator tool which will let you estimate all that.

# To Do
Make it so that it can calculate an end date from a given start date.

# To Consider Doing
Make it so users can set constants such as length of working day and working week to suit their circumstances rather than them being hardcoded in.
